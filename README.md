- 👀 For now, I’m interested in FL and NLP, and these are the places where my recently research lays.
- 🏫 I’m currently a senior student major in CS at Chongqing University, China.
- 🤗 I relish sports are hiking, yoga, loping, tennis, gym working, swimming and so on. Also, I am a big fan of various movies and books.I'd be quite thrilled if we share the common taste! Plus, I'm totally obsessed with the Lord of the Rings and the other tales about the Middle Earth in Tolkein's books
- 📣 I now work as a software engineer intern at Microsoft, Shanghai, and my group focuses on data platform, which belongs to DevDiv, thus lately I have been looking into spark and other things concerning with big data, feel free if you have any suggestions!
