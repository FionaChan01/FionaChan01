- 👋 Hi, I’m Qianchen(Fiona), happy to meet u here!
- 👀 For now, I’m interested in FL and NLP, and these are the places where my recently research lays.
- 🏫 I’m currently a senior student in Chongqing University, China.
- 🤗 I do enjoy lots of habits! I relish sports are hiking, yoga, loping, tennis, gym working, swimming and so on. Also, I am a big fan of movies and books. It is pretty hard to tell my favorites, but I can rank _Cloud Atlas_, _Fight Club_ and _The Secret Life of Walter Mitty_ as my top3. I'd be quite thrilled if we have the common taste! Do let me know!
- 📣 Oh right! I'm quite obsessed with the Lord of the Rings and the other tales about the middle earth in Tolkein's books.
